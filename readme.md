## Basic searching
    
    (default) large resist
        大抵
    (default) 107 1832
        大抵
    (default) large 1832
        大抵

If words are not found, they are converted to hiragana if the ```romkan``` module is installed (optional). 
This ```romkan``` module which can be downloaded [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/romkan). 

Examples:
    
    (default) large てい
        大てい
    (default) large 抵
        大抵
    (default) large tei
        大てい

To quit, type ```.q```.

## Modes 

There are four modes (in parenthesis: command to activate mode)

* default (```.d```): Do nothing.
* copy (```.c```): Copy result to clipboard.
* lookup (```.w```): Lookup expression (default: tangorin.com with firefox)
* conditional: Lookup expression if the search gave a unique result
* primitive (```.p```): Try to find kanji by specifying primitives (this requires an additional file that contains all the kanji stories of the user)

The current mode is displayed by the prompt.

If the input matches more than one result, no action will be performed, regardless of the current mode.
